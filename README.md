# Ainoiceguard

A real-time noise cancellation desktop app for Windows, built with Electron + a native C++ addon. It captures audio from your microphone, runs it through the [RNNoise](https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise) neural network, and routes the clean output to a virtual cable (e.g. VB-Cable) that other apps can use as a microphone.

> Inspired by Krisp. Fully open-source.

- WASAPI backend via PortAudio (exclusive or shared mode)
- Lock-free SPSC ring buffer between capture and processing threads
- System tray UI — device selector, suppression slider, on/off toggle

## Build

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahadi1000/ainoiceguard.git
cd ainoiceguard
```

### 2. Install Node dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build the native addon

This step fetches PortAudio and RNNoise via CMake (FetchContent), compiles them as static libs, then compiles the `.node` addon with node-gyp.

```powershell
npm run build:native
```

Internally this runs `scripts/build-native.ps1` which:

1. Runs CMake to build PortAudio + RNNoise into `deps/install/`
2. Runs `node-gyp rebuild` to compile `ainoiceguard.node`

### 4. Rebuild for Electron ABI (required after `npm install`)

```bash
npm run rebuild:electron
```

### 5. (Optional) Build a distributable installer

```bash
npm run dist:full
```

Output is placed in `dist/`.

---

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs in the system tray. No visible window — look for the tray icon in the taskbar notification area.

> If the tray icon does not appear, check that Electron is finding `build/Release/ainoiceguard.node`. Run `npm run rebuild:electron` if you get a "wrong ABI" error.

---

## VB-Cable Setup

Ainoiceguard outputs processed audio to a virtual cable, which other apps see as a clean microphone.

1. **Download and install** [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) (free).
2. **Open Ainoiceguard** from the tray.
3. Set **Input** to your physical microphone.
4. Set **Output** to **"CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)"**.
5. In **Discord / Zoom / Teams**, set the microphone to **"CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)"**.

```
Physical Mic  →  Ainoiceguard  →  CABLE Input  →  CABLE Output  →  Discord/Zoom
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — bug fixes, new features, platform ports, documentation improvements. Here is how to get started:

### Getting started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ainoiceguard.git
   cd ainoiceguard
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your change. Use a descriptive name:

   ```bash
   # For a feature
   git checkout -b feat/deepfilter-integration

   # For a bug fix
   git checkout -b fix/wasapi-exclusive-mode-crash

   # For documentation
   git checkout -b docs/macos-build-guide
   ```

4. **Make your changes**, then commit using a clear message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add DeepFilterNet as optional DSP backend"
   ```
5. **Push** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/deepfilter-integration
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch (see below).

### Commit message style

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

| Prefix      | When to use                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `feat:`     | New feature                          |
| `fix:`      | Bug fix                              |
| `perf:`     | Performance improvement              |
| `refactor:` | Code restructure, no behavior change |
| `docs:`     | Documentation only                   |
| `test:`     | Tests                                |
| `chore:`    | Build scripts, CI, tooling           |

### Code style

- **C++**: Follow the existing style (4-space indent, `snake_case` for locals, `PascalCase` for classes). Keep audio callbacks allocation-free.
- **JavaScript**: 2-space indent, single quotes, no semicolons are fine if consistent with surrounding code.
- Do not add new runtime dependencies without discussion in an issue first.

### Pull Request guidelines

When you open a PR:

- Fill in the PR template (title, what changed, why, how to test).
- Link the related issue with `Closes #<issue-number>` in the description if applicable.
- Keep PRs focused — one logical change per PR. Large PRs are hard to review.
- Make sure the project still builds (`npm run build:native && npm run rebuild:electron && npm start` should work).
- Describe any new configuration, environment variable, or dependency you added.

PRs are reviewed on a best-effort basis. Feedback will be left as review comments.
